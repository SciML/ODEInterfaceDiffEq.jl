# Deprecation Warning Review

## Summary
This document summarizes the review of deprecation warnings in the ODEInterfaceDiffEq.jl package as of January 2025.

## Findings

### Dependency Deprecation Warning
During testing, the following warning appears:
```
┌ Warning: `@mtkbuild` is deprecated. Use `@mtkcompile` instead.
│   caller = ip:0x0
└ @ Core :-1
```

This warning originates from the **ODEProblemLibrary** dependency, not from ODEInterfaceDiffEq.jl itself.

### ODEInterfaceDiffEq.jl Source Code Review
- ✅ No deprecation warnings in the package's own source code
- ✅ No usage of deprecated Julia language features
- ✅ No usage of `@mtkbuild` or other deprecated macros

## Conclusion
ODEInterfaceDiffEq.jl itself contains no deprecation warnings. The package is up-to-date with current Julia practices. The `@mtkbuild` deprecation warning is from a test dependency (ODEProblemLibrary) and does not affect the package's core functionality.

## Recommendation
The deprecation warning should be addressed in the ODEProblemLibrary package, not in ODEInterfaceDiffEq.jl.

## CI Status
✅ Tests pass successfully
✅ No deprecation warnings in package source code
⚠️ Dependency deprecation warning present (not actionable in this package)
